<h1>About</h1>
This is a simple website made with React that asks a series of questions about a map to find a date range for the map's creation.

All of the questions are located in src/choices.json, and most of them are lifted straight from <a href="https://xkcd.com/1688/">this</a> XKCD comic.

<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Update styling to look better and render on phones/tablets/etc. with no issue</li>
  <li>Add a tooltip to all (or most) questions to clarify any misunderstandings, perhaps with a picture of a real example map</li>
  <li>Find more questions to narrow down date ranges further</li>
</ul>
